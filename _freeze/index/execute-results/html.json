In the US, public spending on risk reduction efforts totaled over $X in 2024, and demand for such funds regularly exceeds available funding. Evidence suggests that in this competitive landscape for funding, urban and whiter communities have fared better at obtaining funding but are often spending it on more disadvantaged neighborhoods within them. However, the reasons for this trend are unclear: complexities in the application process, cost-benefit analysis requirements, and flood damage may all play a role in driving the uneven funding patterns. Here, using a novel dataset tracking properties from flood exposure to application to funding receipt, we identify how each hurdle in the mitigation process shapes the properties that ultimately benefit.  Our findings suggest that application for federal flood mitigation assistance serves as a pinch point where  homeowners in less-white neighborhoods and more affordable homes relative to their neighbors apply. This trend deepens for those who ultimately receive funding, while higher flood-exposure has minimal correlation, implying that funding may not reach all who need it or may be interested. \nkeywords: \n  - Flood mitigation\n  - Climate resilience\ndate: last-modified\nbibliography: bibliography.bib\nformat:\n  html:\n    toc: true\n  elsevier-pdf:\n    keep-tex: true\n    journal:\n      name: Journal Name\n      formatting: preprint\n      # model: 3p # Don't set a model with preprint\n      cite-style: authoryear\n---\n\n\n\n\nPlease make sure that your manuscript follows the guidelines in the \nGuide for Authors of the relevant journal. It is not necessary to \ntypeset your manuscript in exactly the same way as an article, \nunless you are submitting to a camera-ready copy (CRC) journal.\n\nFor detailed instructions regarding the elsevier article class, see   <https://www.elsevier.com/authors/policies-and-guidelines/latex-instructions>\n\n# Bibliography styles\n\nHere are two sample references:  @Feynman1963118 @Dirac1953888.\n\nWith this template using elsevier class, natbib will be used. Three bibliographic style ﬁles (*.bst) are provided and their use controled by `cite-style` option: \n\n- `citestyle: number` (default)  will use `elsarticle-num.bst` - can be used for the numbered scheme\n- `citestyle: numbername` will use `elsarticle-num-names.bst` - can be used for numbered with new options of natbib.sty\n- `citestyle: authoryear` will use `elsarticle-harv.bst` — can be used for author year scheme\n\nThis `citestyle` will insert the right `.bst` and set the correct `classoption` for `elsarticle` document class.\n\nUsing `natbiboptions` variable in YAML header, you can set more options for `natbib` itself . Example \n\n```yaml\nnatbiboptions: longnamesfirst,angle,semicolon\n```\n\n## Using CSL \n\nIf `cite-method` is set to `citeproc` in `elsevier_article()`, then pandoc is used for citations instead of `natbib`. In this case, the `csl` option is used to format the references. By default, this template will provide an appropriate style, but alternative `csl` files are available from <https://www.zotero.org/styles?q=elsevier>. These can be downloaded\nand stored locally, or the url can be used as in the example header.\n\n# Equations\n\nHere is an equation:\n$$ \n  f_{X}(x) = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right)\n  \\left(\\frac{x}{\\beta}\\right)^{\\alpha-1}\n  e^{-\\left(\\frac{x}{\\beta}\\right)^{\\alpha}}; \n  \\alpha,\\beta,x > 0 .\n$$\n\nInline equations work as well: $\\sum_{i = 2}^\\infty\\{\\alpha_i^\\beta\\}$\n\n# Figures and tables\n\n@fig-meaningless is generated using an R chunk.\n\n\n\n\n::: {#cell-fig-meaningless .cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nplot(runif(25), runif(25))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A meaningless scatterplot](index_files/figure-html/fig-meaningless-1.png){#fig-meaningless fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# Tables coming from R\n\nTables can also be generated using R chunks, as shown in @tbl-simple example.\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-simple .cell tbl-cap='Caption centered above table'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::kable(head(mtcars)[,1:4])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|                  |  mpg| cyl| disp|  hp|\n|:-----------------|----:|---:|----:|---:|\n|Mazda RX4         | 21.0|   6|  160| 110|\n|Mazda RX4 Wag     | 21.0|   6|  160| 110|\n|Datsun 710        | 22.8|   4|  108|  93|\n|Hornet 4 Drive    | 21.4|   6|  258| 110|\n|Hornet Sportabout | 18.7|   8|  360| 175|\n|Valiant           | 18.1|   6|  225| 105|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# References {-}\n",
